3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Open `../brocli/brocli` to install the extension
5. Make code changes using your preferred editor

For more information on developing and loading unpacked chrome extensions, see chrome's extensions [Getting Started Tuturial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) (developer.chrome.com).

## Committing
* Always include subject; include body when necessary
* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use imperative mood ("Fix broken link..." not "Fixes broken link...")
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Making a Pull Request
